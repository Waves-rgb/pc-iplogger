# Powercord IP logger
IP logger plugin for powercord

I wrote a custom exploit to grab people's IPs through discord.

# Usage

Type `.ipgrab` and it will grab the last message's author's IP

# Installation

Goto your powercord plugin directory and run

`git clone https://github.com/Waves-rgb/pc-iplogger.git`

As simple as that
